Welcome to TCP Data Transmission Lab!
This is a sample text file that demonstrates real data transfer using TCP protocols.

The file contains multiple lines of text that will be transmitted from client to server.
Each packet will carry actual data chunks instead of just packet identifiers.

TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno algorithms will be tested with this real data transmission.
The congestion control mechanisms will manage how this data flows through the network.

Line 8: This helps us analyze the performance differences between the two algorithms.
Line 9: Packet loss simulation will affect how quickly this data reaches the destination.
Line 10: Fast retransmit and fast recovery mechanisms will be triggered during transmission.

Line 12: The server will acknowledge each received data chunk.
Line 13: Performance metrics will show throughput, RTT, and packet loss rates.
Line 14: This realistic scenario provides better insights into TCP behavior.

Line 16: Additional content to make the file larger for transmission testing.
Line 17: More data means more packets and better congestion control demonstration.
Line 18: Each line represents a portion of data that needs reliable delivery.

Line 20: TCP ensures all this data arrives correctly at the destination.
Line 21: End of sample data file for TCP transmission testing.

Line 22: Extended content begins here for comprehensive testing scenarios.
Line 23: Larger files help demonstrate TCP's sliding window protocol effectively.
Line 24: Window size adjustments occur dynamically based on network conditions.
Line 25: Congestion avoidance phase shows exponential growth in window size.

Line 27: Slow start algorithm begins with window size of one segment.
Line 28: Exponential increase continues until slow start threshold is reached.
Line 29: Network bandwidth utilization improves with proper window management.
Line 30: Buffer overflow prevention is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

Line 32: Duplicate acknowledgments trigger fast retransmit mechanisms.
Line 33: TCP Reno's fast recovery differs significantly from TCP Tahoe's approach.
Line 34: Timeout events reset congestion window to initial values in Tahoe.
Line 35: Reno maintains higher throughput by avoiding slow start after fast retransmit.

Line 37: Sequence numbers ensure proper ordering of transmitted data segments.
Line 38: Acknowledgment numbers confirm successful receipt of data packets.
Line 39: Checksum verification prevents corrupted data from being accepted.
Line 40: Flow control prevents sender from overwhelming receiver's buffer capacity.

Line 42: Maximum segment size negotiation occurs during connection establishment.
Line 43: Path MTU discovery optimizes packet size for network infrastructure.
Line 44: Fragmentation at IP layer can impact TCP performance significantly.
Line 45: Nagle's algorithm reduces small packet overhead in interactive applications.

Line 47: Delayed acknowledgments improve network efficiency by reducing ACK traffic.
Line 48: Cumulative acknowledgments allow recovery from multiple packet losses.
Line 49: Selective acknowledgments provide more granular loss recovery information.
Line 50: Window scaling option enables high-bandwidth delay product networks.

Line 52: Connection establishment uses three-way handshake for reliable setup.
Line 53: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets initialize sequence numbers properly.
Line 54: Connection termination requires four-way handshake for clean closure.
Line 55: FIN packets ensure all data is transmitted before connection ends.

Line 57: Keep-alive mechanisms detect broken connections in long-idle sessions.
Line 58: Socket buffer sizes affect application performance and memory usage.
Line 59: TCP options provide extensibility for future protocol enhancements.
